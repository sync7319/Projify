# Projify
coding up website for a project based marketplace connecting students to companies through low commitment low cost and low risk projects, this approach was later scrapped for using a website builder to ease the process and tools for a limited time limit till the competition, but still wanted to leave the project here to showcase I learned CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. However the slides has a figma mock up of how it was implemented for the time being.
